Overall Operation : 
request --->
............ (may include proxies, etc)

Mechanisms specified in the augmented BNF form 

URI consists of URN and URL --> generally URL is used 

->http url format :
http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]

  entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network 
  # Whenever a transfer-coding is applied to a message-body, the set of
   transfer-codings MUST include "chunked"

->Media Types:
